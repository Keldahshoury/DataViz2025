# Research Question Ideas
1. How the global warming has affected the number of visits to the national parks
2. How does relative distance to a mid-size city (~100,000 - 500,000 ppl) and larger affect number of visits to a national park
3. How do regional and state-level differences affect visitor counts, and can we predict visitor trends for underutilized parks?
4. Using supplemental climate data, can we assess the impact of weather patterns on visitation numbers?
5. How does visitor composition (e.g., tent campers, RV campers, backcountry users) vary over the years?

# Machine Learning Question:
1. How an increase in global warming temperatures will affect future number of parks visited (if we find any relation between the two)
2. Can we recommend optimal resource allocation (e.g., staff, camping facilities) for parks based on predicted visitation patterns?

# Notes

Use era5 data to get weather, 
  Variables: Mean Snowfall Rate,
             Mean Snowmelt Rate,
             Mean Total Percitpitation Rate,
             Skin Temperature (surface temp, could be useful for camping viz),
             Snow Depth,
             2m Temperature,
             Snowfall,
             Snowmelt,
             Total Column Ozone,
             Type of high vegetation,
             Type of low vegetation
